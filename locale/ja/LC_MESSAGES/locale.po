"This tutorial aims to show using Python to pre-processing, solve, and post-"
"processing of Finite Element Method analysis. It uses a finite element "
"method library with a Python interface called `GetFEM "
"<http://getfem.org/>`__ for preprocessing and solving. We will load vtk file"
" by using `meshio <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`__ and visualize by "
"`matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>`__ in pre-processing "
"and post-processing. This tutorial was used in the `PyConJP 2019 talk "
"<https://pycon.jp/2019/schedule/?sessionId=120>`__. You can watch the talk "
"on YouTube below. This tutorial is based on the following `official GetFEM "
"page tutorial <http://getfem.org/tutorial/thermo_coupling.html>`__."
